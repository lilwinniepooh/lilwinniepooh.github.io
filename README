Hello,

This is Project MEME CHINA

Please submit a pull request with added memes to the memes/ folder, and let's do this thing!

Why?

Because FUCK the Communist Party of China

Yeah, that's right, FUCK THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA!

That includes the General Secretary Xi Jinping, the one who looks like Winnie the Pooh.

Also because I heard that china doesn't block github because it's "too important" or something, so I see one of two things happening:

1. China gets memed and blocks github

2. Github bans me because Microsoft loves $$$ and attacks our freedom.

I hope to Christopher Robin that Microsoft takes the right side of things, but who knows.

Let's protest!
